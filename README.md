🔐 0x02: Technical_Intelligence
I am Ramen, a cybersecurity researcher and professional developer specializing in the deep-level modification and analysis of iOS applications and gaming architectures. My work focuses on the intersection of binary reverse engineering and dynamic instrumentation, where I leverage my mastery across all computer languages to dismantle security protocols and optimize application performance through custom mods.
📱 iOS Modding & Reverse Engineering Methodology
My research involves the comprehensive analysis of Mach-O binaries, utilizing both static and dynamic vectors to achieve precision modifications:
Dynamic Hooking: Utilizing Frida and Cycript to intercept Objective-C and Swift runtimes, bypassing SSL Pinning and Jailbreak detectio
Static Decomposition: Advanced disassembly of game engines and app binaries using IDA Pro and Hopper to locate memory offsets and logic gates. 
Tweak Development: Building high-performance system modifications via Theos and Logos, targeting both local file manipulation and runtime patching.
Game Logic Modification: Analyzing game state machines to implement speed managers, cheat engines, and architectural enhancements.

Security Research and Bug Bounty Metrics
For a hacker-centric profile, showcasing contributions to platforms like HackerOne or Bugcrowd is essential to establish real-world credibility. These platforms serve as third-party verification of Ramen's ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in production environments. The inclusion of these metrics signals to potential collaborators and employers that the user’s skills have been validated against major organizational infrastructures, such as GitHub's own security program, which offers significant rewards for critical vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability Disclosure and CTF Methodology
The profile should include a section for "Hacktivity" or "Security Research Highlights," which details the researcher's approach to discovery. This may include: 
CVE Identifiers: Listing specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identified by the researcher.
Bug Bounty Badges: Utilizing custom Shields.io badges to represent ranks or awards from platforms like HackerOne
Capture The Flag (CTF) Performance: Summarizing performance in major competitions (e.g., HackTheBox or TryHackMe), which demonstrate the breadth of the researcher's exploitation skills across diverse operating systems.
